  Introduction
  </strong>
</h4>
 	
<p>A fire blanket is a safety device designed to extinguish incipient (starting) fires. It consists of a sheet of a fire retardant material which is placed over a fire in order to smother it.

Small fire blankets, such as for use in kitchens and around the home are usually made of fiberglass and sometimes kevlar, and are folded into a quick-release contraption for ease of storage.

Fire blankets, along with fire extinguishers, are fire safety items that can be useful in case of a fire. These nonflammable blankets are helpful in temperatures up to 900 degrees and are useful in smothering fires by not allowing any oxygen to the fire. Due to its simplicity, a fire blanket may be more helpful for someone who is inexperienced with fire extinguishers.

Larger fire blankets, for use in laboratory and industrial situations, are often made of wool (sometimes treated with a flame retardant fluid). These blankets are usually mounted in vertical quick-release container so that they can be easily pulled out and wrapped round a person whose clothes are on fire.  </p>
